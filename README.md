### Network Protocols
- IP (Internet Protocol)
    - IP packets has header and data
    - header contains src and dest IP address
    - IP packets are limited in size of 2^16 bytes
        - limited size means need to send multiple packets
        - higher chance of packets loss
        - IP does not guarantee order of packets sent

- TCP (transmission control protocol)
    - built on top of IP, meant to solve issues above
        - ensures order of packets in an error free way (knows if packets are corrupted)
        - also knows when packets keep failing to get received
    - tcp header part of the ip packet

- HTTP
